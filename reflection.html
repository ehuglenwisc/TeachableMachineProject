<h1>Reflection on "Unmasking AI"</h1>
<p>
  In this project, I have reflected on Buolamwini's insights in her book "Unmasking AI." One key lesson is the importance of considering bias in machine learning. As we create and train models, we must be vigilant about the data we use and the potential biases it may carry. This activity deepened my understanding of how bias in AI can impact real-world applications, and it has motivated me to prioritize ethical considerations in future projects.
